# gabrielmmelo's window ðŸªŸ

## 
Hi there! I'm Gabriel Melo and this is my Personal Blog/Digital Garden/[[Portfolio|Portfolio]]. I would rather refer to it as ==my digital window==, through which I can see the world and share a little bit of my ~~home~~ mind. Here I post all I write about my studies, interests, and insights regarding a not-well-defined scope of matters. From computer science to politics, I write as an attempt to better understand the world I'm surrounded by, as well as my own thoughts and behaviors.

For information about how this window is organized and implemented, check out [[00_inbox/Window|Window]]; if you are interested in my career, projects, and accomplishes as a Data Engineer, I kindly shared my [[Portfolio|Portfolio]]; if you, for any reason, want to know more about ~~my self-description~~ me, take a look at [[00_inbox/Me|Me]].

All content shared within this space[^1] reflects the perceptions and points of view I had at the time of writing. My opinions are, by definition, limited and biased.

*Be welcome.*
