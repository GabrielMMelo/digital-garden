## Introduction
Hi there! I'm Gabriel Melo and this is my Personal Blog/[[Digital Garden|Digital Garden]]/Portfolio. Here I post all I write about my studies, interests, and insights regarding a not-well-defined scope of matters. From computer science to politics, I write in an attempt to better understand the world I'm surrounded by, as well as my own thoughts and behaviors.
