# gabrielmmelo's window ðŸªŸ

Hi there! I'm Gabriel M. de Melo and this is my Personal Blog/Digital Garden. I would rather refer to it as ==my digital window==, through which I can see the world and share a little bit of my ~~home~~ mind. Here I post some pieces of stuff I write about my studies, personal projects, interests, and insights regarding a not-well-defined scope of matters. I write to better understand the world I'm surrounded by, my thoughts, and my behaviors.

For information about how this window is implemented and organized, check out [[01_projects/blog/Window\|Window]]; if you are interested in my career, projects, and accomplishes as a Data Engineer, I kindly shared a [[00_inbox/Portfolio\|Portfolio]]-ish; if you, for any motivation, want to know more about ~~my self-description~~ me, take a look at [[00_inbox/Me\|Me]].

All content shared within this space[^1] reflects the perceptions and points of view I had at the time of writing. My opinions are, by definition, limited and biased.

*Be welcome.*
